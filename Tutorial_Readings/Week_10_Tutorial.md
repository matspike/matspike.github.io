# Complex (mal)adaptive systems

At the start of the course, I recommended that you check out this extremely cool interactive guide to the evolution of trust by Nicky Case, a Canadian game developer who I wish someone would put in charge of the world's educational systems. In this week's tutorial, I've just about managed to contrive a valid excuse for playing two more of Case's micro-masterpieces, so if anyone asks you to wash the dishes instead of sitting around playing games you can tell them this is *educational*, and actually yes it *is* from the same course as that psychedelic mushroom ape thing. Anyway:

## Complex adaptive systems and language

**Complexity science** and **chaos** became a hot topic back in the 80s. There were a bunch reasons for this: across the natural and social sciences, for as long as those had been a thing, there has always been a strong pull towards [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism), which is the idea that doing sciencey stuff involves breaking the thing you're interested in up into smaller, simpler bits. Once you know what all the bits are, and what the bits do, then you've understood everything you need to know about the bigger thing you started with: *the whole is the sum of its parts*. If that's how the world works, then language (for example) just reduces to psychology, and then psychology reduces to neuroscience, neuroscience reduces to biology, biology reduces to chemistry, and of course chemistry reduces to particle physics, which reduces to strings or something apparently. Of course, lots of people weren't super happy about this general idea - it's hard to see how things like [the historical development of the english language can be explained by the physics of expanding gases](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/02/10/when-physicists-linguistics/ZoHNxhE6uunmM7976nWsRP/story.html) whenever a physicst walks into your office by mistake. On the other hand, it had never been clear how to think about a general kind of science which works in the opposite direction, i.e. from smaller to bigger. Actually, some physicists (of course) had thought a lot about this, but there was no way to connect this kind of stuff to things as different from each other as
