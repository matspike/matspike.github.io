# Week 2 Tutorial briefing: Pinker on language evolution

The first tutorial is fairly straightforward: read **Chapters 1 and 2** (they're very short, don't worry of [this *brand-new book* from Cedric Boeckx](./142.pdf), and turn up prepared to ask questions about it and discuss it. This short book is a very personal and non-technical summary of Bockx’s take on language: what it’s for and how it evolved.

Below, we suggest some issues you could consider when you are reading it and discussing it in your groups, but don’t feel constrained by these. If there is a basic issue from the readings or lectures that your tutor can help clear up, this is a good opportunity to raise it in a smaller group setting.

## Possible points to consider
* Boeckx argues against non-evolutionary perspectives on language. What does that mean?
* What kinds of arguments and evidence does he think we have access to?
* What kinds of alternative hypotheses does he consider? Are you satisfied with his grounds for dismissing them?
* How does what he is saying fit into the FLN vs FLB distinction employed by Fitch? What use does he make of the kind of comparative data that Fitch emphasises?
* What does he think of simple explanations of language? Do you think he's right?
* What does he say about the role of culture and biology in language? What are *your* thoughts?
* Do you find him persuasuive? What are the convincing points? What are the weaknesses?
