# Week 6 Tutorial

No reading this week, but I'll ask you to watch a lecture given by **Professor Cecilia Heyes**. Heyes is one of the world's leading developmental psychologists, and over the course of her career has, through both experimental and theoretical work, critically re-examined a wide range work in developmental and evolutionary psychology, challenging both their assumptions and conclusions.

More recently, she has brought her research programme together into a coherent theoretical framework, which she calls 'Cultural Evolutionary Psychology'. If you want to read more about her work, I highly recommmend looking at her book (available via the library [here](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/44UOE_INST/7g3mt6/alma9924120796002466), but we only seem to have one copy so tell me if you can't get hold of it), or the precis of the book [here](./Tutorial_readings/Heyes_2019_Pr√©cis of Cognitive Gadgets.pdf).

In the meantime, watch the lecture in the video below, and while you're watching make a note of any questions you have about the material, using the prompts below as a guide
