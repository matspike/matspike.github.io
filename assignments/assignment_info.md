# Assignments

## Overview:
The aim of the assignments on this course is to start building up a **wiki-style** collection of material on any and all topics connected to language evolution, which your submission will contribute to. My other intention is to give you the opportunity to try to submit your ideas in a *non-traditional*, i.e. not necessarily anything that looks like an academic essay. This could include:
  1. Written work, but in the form of an article in a popular science venue (for example), a blog, or a tutorial introduction to some topic (such as one would expect in a wiki), or anything else you can come up with. Or even an academic-style essay!
  2. Audio recordings: this could be a podcast discussion between a group of students on a linked theme, or an individually presented documentary-style segment, or even an interview with a researcher on their work.
  3. A recorded video in some format, such as a conference-style presentation, an informal lecture, an educational video or tutorial, and so on.
  4. (for the brave or foolhardy) An interactive presentation using some web technology.
  5. Anything else you can think of!

## What you need to do:
  1. **Think of a general topic**: basically, choose any topic which has come up so far on the course that *you found interesting* and would like to know more about. For some people, this will be easy; for others, it can be very difficult and disorienting. I have put some suggestions in a section later on which you can feel free to use or adapt as you like, but feel free to pick something completely different, and come to me if you still feel lost (which is totally fine and expected, this is a massive topic after all).
  2. **Think of a specific, concrete, targeted question within that topic**. This is easier said than done! All of the topics we have covered have such a wide scope that it's very easy to get lost in the literature, chasing down new papers in unfamiliar disciplines. I speak from personal experience when i say that this can be very disorienting! There are a number of ways to avoid this, luckily. Two examples are:
    * Choose a specific target paper to focus on, and concentrate on how it interacts with the rest of the literature. If the paper is a bit older, see how it looks in the light of new evidence. If other papers agree or (more likely) disagree with it, find out how and see if *you* agree.
    * Choose a **very** specific question. For example, instead of 'What is social evolution', something like 'what evidence do these studies of social behaviour of wild chimpanzees in Uganda contribute to our understanding of human social evolution?'
  3. **Choose a medium, style of presentation, and collaborators if necessary**. As above, this can be anything from a individual piece of work such as a traditional academic essay, to a pair discussion in a podcast, to a group of you creating an educational-style video. Some people will be tempted to do something wildly ambitious here, but be *very* careful here as some types of presentation take *a lot* more work than others, for example planning, preparing, and editing a video.
  4. **Tell me what your project is, or if you're feeling totally lost** I'll create a channel on Teams for people to tell me their plans - if you'd rather not discuss it in public just say so in there and I can contact you more directly (whether you're planning to work individually or in a group).
  5. **Plan your project:**
    * What is your exact topic?
    * How will you structure you project into smaller parts? How do they connect?
    * What materials do you need?
    * How long do you think preparation and practicalities such as editing will take?
    * Triple the above number
    * Rethink your plans in the light of the new, bigger number
    * If working as a group:
      * Assign roles - who does what?
      * In light of the above, try to structure roles in a *modular* way. What happens if someone gets ill? What happens if part of someone's plan doesn't work out? Whose work relies on someone else's, and can you think of ways to avoid a bottleneck?

## Caveats

As above, keep the following in the front of your mind as much as possible:
  1. Scope: are you trying to cover too much material?
  2. Demands of the task: are you being too ambitious?
  3. Content not length: a 2000 word essay is not the same amount of work as a video with 2000 words in it. Think about the *topics* and *content* you would put in an essay of that length, and think about how that would translate into your chosen for, and *importantly*, how much work/time that will entail.
  4. Collaboration practicalities: how will you communicate, when and where will you meet, and *very importantly* how can you structure the project so it won't get thrown off track if someone gets ill etc.

You can always, of course, come to me with any questions you might have!

## Specifics:

The assignment is your opportunity to show that you understand more than the
content of the lectures and set readings – you should take it as a chance to show that
you have carried out independent reading beyond the syllabus, can produce your own
interpretation of the material you have read, and use it to build your own arguments and analysis
 Try to find your own material - work which doesn’t depart significantly from the
set content of the course (lecture and tutorial readings) and/or which only work
with the ‘starter’ readings will have a much harder time getting a good mark. You must demonstrate
critical engagement with the course content and the wider literature – ideally you will show that you have approached the question in an open-minded but
skeptical manner, carefully seeking out, scrutinising, and evaluating the evidence
behind theories and ideas, and drawing your own conclusions that represent a fair
consideration of the available evidence.
 Finally, it may sound superfluous, but many students forget this: after
finishing your project, look at it at least one more time! For written work, for example, reading out loud is especially useful:
if you stumble to process sentences you just wrote, your reader will probably be
stopped in their tracks (in a bad way). **Never forget your audience**: imagine you are
your intended reader/listener/viewer and check if you would make sense, and if your
explanations are clear enough. Whether written or otherwise, it is better to have short and understandable
sentences than to spin long one-sentence arguments. Keep it simple and clear - this is an important and surprisingly difficult skill (and rare in academia, alas)!

## Finding literature
You need to be targeted in identifying relevant articles to read for your specific
essay topic. The starter articles for each topic are intended to give you an opening into
the literature, so you should use them to guide your initial search (but don’t feel
constrained by them). There are several ways you could do this.
  * Check for relevant work by the same authors - look for their personal or
institutional webpage, or find their Google Scholar profile, and look through other
research they have done.
  * Perform targeted searches on Google Scholar or DiscoverED. Googling
“language evolution” is not going to get you very far for these assignments - these
are specific topics that require specific reading. Look for phrases you want to know
more about to conduct specific searches.
* Work outwards from a focal paper. Look at the reference list of the paper you are
reading and chase up papers that they cite - this will allow you to work backwards
in time from your focal paper. To work forwards in time, find papers which cite the
focal paper you are reading.
 For all these approaches, keep an eye out for reliable, in-depth sources: e.g.,
trust peer-reviewed journals over brief conference abstracts or popular reports.
 Various tools exist to make working outwards from a focal paper easier, and
this is generally a useful and popular method. Google Scholar provides a list of papers
which cite a given paper, allowing you to work forward. Web of Science (http://
wok.mimas.ac.uk) makes it easy to go both forwards and backwards in time – for
every paper on there, there is a linked list of papers it cites and papers that cite it. You
can apply these procedures recursively – there may be relevant papers in the papers
that cite a paper that cites your focal paper, and so on.
 A combination of these techniques should get you started, and will probably
generate more papers than you can possibly read, so you need to be somewhat
selective. Use the title and abstract of a paper to get the gist of what it’s about, and
pursue the papers which you think will provide the most relevant evidence, or which
are most helpful (or most difficult) for the argument you are trying to develop. And
look for converging evidence – few single papers provide an uncontroversial and
definitive “truth” on any subject, but a converging body of work showing the same
sort of results should give you more confidence.

## Example topics

1. Humans are unusual in possessing language, but we are also unusually adept tool
users, and are capable of forming and executing complex plans. Are our linguistic
capacities related to our abilities in tool use and planning, and can these nonlinguistic capacities tell us something about the evolution of language?

  Transactions of the Royal Society B, 363, 1939-1949.**
2. Humans are prolific word learners, learning tens of thousands of words in a short
space of time. Do humans have cognitive specializations for word learning, and if
so, do these represent cognitive adaptations (the product of natural selection,
rewarding better word learners), or something else?

  95, 201-236.**
3. There is a small industry in studying the ability of humans and non-human
animals to learn artificial grammars. Some people think this work is important for
understanding key cognitive differences between humans and non-human animals,
and therefore the evolution of language in humans. Others think it’s either badly
done or conceptually flawed or both. What do you think, and why?
