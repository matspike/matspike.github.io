# Form and Function in Language Evolution
This is the course webpage for Matt Spike's 2023 Guided Research course at the universty of Edinburgh.
All material for this course should be linked here, so if you have any questoins this should be your first point of call.

## Topics

1. Function and form in context:
	* The costs and benefits of functional design in:
 		* Technology
 		* Biology
 		* Human cognition and culture
	* The origins of design
		* Biological evolution:
			* Selection, mutation, drift
			* Innovation and constraints
			* Systems and ecology
		* Cultural Evolution
			* Overview: [Mesoudi 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-015-9320-0)
			* Cumulative culture [Caldwell & Millen 2008](https://doi.org/10.1098%2Frstb.2008.0133)
			* Theories:

				* Cultural Attraction Theory [Miton 2022](https://psyarxiv.com/qs2et/)
				* Paris vs California: [Buskell 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/evan.21762)
			* Granularity and scale
	* Explaining Design
		* Explanatory frameworks: 
		 	* Adaptation: 
		 	 	* Meyr's Ultimate/Proximate Distinction: [Laland et al 2011](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1210879) 
		 	 	* Tinbergen's 4 Questions [Spike 2017](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10539-018-9610-x)
		 	* Cognition: 
		 	 	* Marr's 4 levels: [Marr & Poggio 1976](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5782)
		 	 	* Culture & Cognition: [Heyes 2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0051)
		* Extensions: 
		 	* Non-genetic inheritance: [Jablonka & Lamb 2007](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10539-018-9610-x)
		 	* Novelty, Plasticity & Niche Construction: [Sterelny 2009](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-9636-5_7)
		 	* Extended Evolutionary Synthesis: [Laland et al 2015](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.1019)
		* Critiques of adaptationism and teleology in:
		 	* biology: [Gould & Lewontin 1979](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1979.0086)
		 	* (evolutionary) psychology: see [SEP entry, Downes 2021](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-psychology/) 
		 	* culture: [Fracchia & Lewontin 1979](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1979.0086)
2. Natural Communication
	* Biological communication
		* Function as definitional
		* Diverse forms, limited functions
		* Manipulation, inclusive fitness, or group selection?
	* Human communication
		* Are language and communication co-extensive?
		* Diverse forms, unlimited function, and the role of pragmatics
		* Language design: thought or communication?
4.  Information Theory: function and form in generalised communication
5.
