# Matthew Spike

## Bio
I am a Teaching Fellow in Language Evolution and Acquisition based in the department of Linguistics and English Language in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. I was previously a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Australian National University working in the Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language, supervised by Prof. Kim Sterelny, and before this I was a PhD candidate in the Centre for Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Simon Kirby and Prof. Kenny Smith. I also have a BA (Hons 1st class) in Turkish & Linguistics from SOAS, University of London and an MSc (Distinction) in the Evolution of Language and Cognition from the University of Edinburgh.

My professional experience includes time spent in ESL teaching (2005-present: Spain, Turkey, UK),  IT technical support (1999-2003: UK, USA), running a bar (2003-2005: Spain) and brief stints at attempting to be a viniculturist in northern California and an astrophysics student in Edinburgh.

I speak Turkish, Spanish, French, and Python.

## Research Interests
I am interested in how cultural processes contribute to the evolution of linguistic structure and conventions. My general approach is to 1) identify a minimal framework to describe different aspects of language and then 2) determine the minimal requirements - cognitive and social - required for their emergence. For example, I have looked at how populations of learning agents develop signalling systems, and how those signalling systems take on both simple and more complex structures.

Much of this involves the direct comparison of models from several disciplines, including evolutionary linguistics, artificial life, evolutionary game theory and economics. To this end, I primarily use agent-based modelling (typically involving an exemplar-theoretic methodology). This is supported - and heavily influenced - by mathematical tools borrowed from information theory.

I am also interested in empirical applications of the above, particularly in the quantification of structural complexity of both experimental and natural language data.
